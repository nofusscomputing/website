As a minimum and prior to you commencement as a BETA tester I will require the following information:
  * PCID  
    * //(the PCID is generated from the app itself and can be found in the tray icon by right click it (spanner and orange+grey screw driver icon) and click about, the PCID is on the splash window, I should only need the first 8 and last 8 hex digits to marry your PC to the logs and add your PC to the beta testers group.)//

===== Summary =====
 Hopefully and I say this lightly, 99% of the time you won't even notice this application on your computer. This part of the application is just the plugin manager and after a bit more testing I will begin to develop the plugins, this is where you can start to reap the rewards of installing my software and being a beta tester. If you didn't already know I am a single person not an entire organization with endless resources, to that end and around my day job and family life, I work as much a possible to make your computing experience with us a less than painful and enjoyable one. 

If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.


**Please Note**: if you attempt to access our website with a secure connection, i.e. https you will be presented with a certificate error, if this occurs there is no need for concern. We create and self sign our own certificates due to it not being viable to spend thousands of dollars on buying a certificate from a registered Certificate Authority.


Our Certificate Authority details can be found at [[/public/help/nfc_software]].
